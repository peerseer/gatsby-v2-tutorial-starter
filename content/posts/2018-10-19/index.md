Rahul Gandhi lied that Parrikar said he had nothing to do with Rafale deal. He later wrote a letter and tried to divert the topic by saying that what he said was "public domain" but lied in the letter again that Parrikar's aide's mentioned on audio tape that Parrikar said he had Rafale tapes in his bedroom, but those tapes were never authenticaed by anyone including Congress.
